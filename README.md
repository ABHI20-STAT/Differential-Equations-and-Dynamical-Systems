# Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems

## 📖 Repository Description
This repository is a **research-oriented collection** focused on the rigorous study of **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Dynamical Systems, and Fractals**. It integrates **theoretical analysis, computational methods, and modelling applications**, serving as a bridge between pure mathematics and applied sciences.

### 🔗 Connections Between ODEs, PDEs, and Dynamical Systems
- **ODEs** describe the evolution of systems in time, such as population growth, oscillations, or mechanical vibrations.  
- **PDEs** extend this framework to multiple variables, modelling phenomena like heat diffusion, wave propagation, and fluid dynamics.  
- **Dynamical Systems** provide the overarching framework for both ODEs and PDEs can be studied as dynamical systems, where the focus is on the **qualitative behavior of solutions** (stability, bifurcations, chaos).  
- **Fractals and Chaos** emerge naturally in nonlinear dynamical systems. Iterative maps and PDE-driven phenomena (e.g., turbulence) often generate fractal structures, linking analysis to geometry and visualization.
